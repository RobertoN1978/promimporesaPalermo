              Our student firm operates as a fully functional business model where each member has a defined role. 
              From management and marketing to finance, operations, and creative development — every department plays

          <p>
              We work on real projects, develop digital products, simulate economic processes, and collaborate as a 
              united team. This environment helps every member build confidence, leadership qualities, and an 
              understanding of how professional companies function.
          </p>

          <p>
              Our goal is not only to complete tasks but to create meaningful experiences that prepare us for future 
              careers. Through teamwork, dedication, and creativity, we strive to develop skills that last a lifetime.
